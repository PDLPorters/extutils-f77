This module is also used by L<PGPLOT> (for which it was originally developed), L<PDL> (PDL::Minuit and PDL::Slatec), the 
interfaces implemented, respectively, to the Minuit minimization library from CERN, and to parts of the Slatec library, the 
latter also serving the purpose of showing how to interface PDL to an external library.
